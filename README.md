## Overview:

In this third practical application assignment, the goal is to compare the performance of different classifiers (k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines) using a dataset related to the marketing of bank products over the telephone.

## Data:

The dataset used in this project comes from the UCI Machine Learning repository. It consists of data from a Portuguese banking institution and includes the results of multiple marketing campaigns. Additional information on the data and features can be found in the accompanying article within the .zip file provided.

## Deliverables:

After understanding, preparing, and modeling the data, a Jupyter Notebook will be created. The notebook will include the following components:

1. **Understanding of the Business Problem:**
   - Clear statement demonstrating understanding of the business problem, which is to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on various demographic and marketing campaign-related features.

2. **Descriptive and Inferential Statistics:**
   - Correct and concise interpretation of descriptive statistics to summarize key features and the target variable.
   - Discussion on the application (or lack thereof) of inferential statistics in the analysis.

3. **Findings and Insights:**
   - Evaluation of model performance using various classifiers.
   - Identification of actionable insights derived from the analysis, such as the most effective classifier and potential areas for improvement.

4. **Next Steps and Recommendations:**
   - Outline of next steps based on the findings, including recommendations for further analysis or model refinement.
   
## Repository Contents:

## Conclusion:

This project aims to provide insights into the performance of different classifiers in predicting term deposit subscriptions. By understanding the data, applying appropriate modeling techniques, and interpreting the results, the goal is to optimize marketing strategies and resource allocation for the banking institution.




# Bank Term Deposit Subscription Prediction

## Business Problem Statement
The goal of this analysis is to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit (binary outcome: yes or no) based on various demographic and marketing campaign-related features. This prediction can aid in optimizing marketing strategies and resource allocation for future campaigns, ultimately improving the bank's efficiency in acquiring term deposits.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains information about clients, including their age, job, marital status, education, contact method, and details of the marketing campaign they were part of.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Checked for missing values: No missing values were found in the dataset.
- Analyzed the distribution of the target variable ('y') using a count plot, showing a class imbalance.

## Data Preprocessing
- Converted categorical variables into numerical using one-hot encoding.
- Split the data into features (X) and target (y).
- Split the data into training and testing sets.
- Applied feature scaling using StandardScaler.

## Modeling
### Machine Learning Models Used
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier
- Logistic Regression Classifier
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier

### Model Training
- Trained each model using the training data.

### Model Evaluation
- Made predictions using the trained models on the testing data.
- Evaluated model performance using classification reports, accuracy scores, and confusion matrices.

## Interpretation of Descriptive and Inferential Statistics
- Descriptive statistics were utilized to summarize key features and the target variable.
- Inferential statistics were not directly applied in this analysis.

## Findings and Insights
- Among the evaluated classifiers, Logistic Regression and SVM achieved the highest accuracy scores, around 91%.
- Decision Tree Classifier showed relatively lower accuracy but provided insights into feature importance.
- Class imbalance in the target variable might affect model performance and should be addressed through techniques like oversampling or undersampling.

## Next Steps and Recommendations
- Address the class imbalance issue by applying techniques like oversampling (e.g., Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique - SMOTE) or undersampling.
- Fine-tune hyperparameters of the models to potentially improve performance.
- Explore ensemble learning techniques like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting to further enhance predictive accuracy.
- Continuously monitor and evaluate model performance with new data and adjust strategies accordingly.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this analysis demonstrates the application of various machine learning mod
